# HOW TO CHANGE THE STATEMENT OF A REGRESSION TASK A LITTLE AND GET A DEMING REGRESSION, OR HOW TO ESTIMATE A CLOUD OF POINTS

## Abstract
In this article, I approximate the points by a straight line under the assumption that there are no errors. Then I compare this result with the solution of the Deming Regression task.

## Resume

To begin with, we defined a task to solve. The task was to find a line that describes a
cloud of points in the assumption, that there are no errors. Then we concocted out the
relations between b and k and derived an equation for k. The roots of this equation are
critical points, and at some points, the minimum is achieved. Also, how I mentioned,
that this equation always has a positive root.

At the second, we took a second to compare results with the solution of the Deming
Regression task and found out that relations between k and b are the same. However, a
simple experiment revealed that two straight lines, gained by two tasks, are different.

At the third, the work hasn’t ended yet. Further researches should be with more
rigorous details that I missed. Also, there should be more statistically significant
conclusions about the differences between the two solutions.
